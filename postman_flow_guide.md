# üì¨ APS Design Automation ‚Äì Postman Flow Guide

This guide helps you configure and run **Autodesk Platform Services (APS) Design Automation v3** using **Postman**.

The objective is to demonstrate how to use a customized version of the predefined activity `AutoCAD.AcLMVExport+prod` through a step-by-step Postman flow. This includes uploading an AppBundle containing your custom business logic, which injects metadata‚Äîsuch as custom properties on AutoCAD objects like *Walls*‚Äîduring the LMV extraction process.

In other words, the `createcolloboration` activity enables the generation of a specialized output format that LMV-based applications, such as Autodesk Construction Cloud (ACC), can directly consume. The resulting file from this flow can be seamlessly uploaded to ACC for downstream workflows.

üåê Environment Variables (for Postman)

| Variable Name       | Example / Description                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `APS_CLIENT_ID`     | From your APS App                          |
| `APS_CLIENT_SECRET` | From your APS App                          |

‚úÖ Tips
Use Pre-request Script to fetch token automatically in Postman.
Add delays when polling workitem status to avoid rate limits.
Save token and ID values in Environment for chaining requests.
